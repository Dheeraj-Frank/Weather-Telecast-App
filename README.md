# Weather-Telecast-App
It is a simple app which can display the weather telecast of different countries and their cities. We can find weather reports such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed and description etc. of any place in the world. You need to provide the name of a place. Not only this you will also get current time of that place. 
It is a completely gui tkinter project. 
We will use the Open Weather Map API to get the data.
